<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>

<h3>A QUEER OLD PERSON</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a queer old person that lived
in Farmer Green's garden. Nobody knew
exactly how long he had made his home
there because his neighbors seldom saw
him. He might have been in the garden a
whole summer before anybody set eyes on
him.</p>

<p>Those that were acquainted with him
called him Grandfather Mole. And the
reason why his friends didn't meet him<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_2" id="p_2">p. 2</a></span>
oftener was because he spent most of his
time underground. Grandfather Mole's
house was in a mound at one end of the
garden. He had made the house himself,
for he was a great digger. And Mr. Meadow
Mouse often remarked that it had
more halls than any other dwelling he had
ever seen. He had visited it when Grandfather
Mole was away from home, so he
knew what it was like.</p>

<p>Some of those halls that Mr. Meadow
Mouse mentioned ran right out beneath
the surface of the garden. Grandfather
Mole had dug them for a certain purpose.
Through them he made his way in the
darkness, whenever he was hungry (which
was most of the time, for he had a huge
appetite!). And when he took an underground
stroll he was almost sure to find a
few angleworms, which furnished most of
his meals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_3" id="p_3">p. 3</a></span>To be sure, he did not despise a grub&mdash;if
he happened to meet one&mdash;nor a cutworm
nor a wire-worm.</p>

<p>The wonder of it was that Grandfather
Mole ever found anything to eat, for the
old gentleman was all but blind. The only
good Grandfather Mole's eyes did him
was to let him tell darkness from light.
They were so small that his neighbors
claimed he hadn't any at all.</p>

<p>Another odd thing about this odd person
was his ears. The neighbors said they
couldn't see them, either. But they were
in his head, even if they didn't show. And
Grandfather Mole himself sometimes remarked
that he didn't know how he could
have burrowed as he did if he had been
forever getting dirt in his eyes and ears.
He seemed quite satisfied to be just as he
was.</p>

<p>And he used to say that he didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_4" id="p_4">p. 4</a></span>
know what good eyes were to anyone
whether he was under the ground or on
top of it!</p>

<p>Liking to dig as he did, he certainly had
nothing to complain about. His long nose
was as good as a drill. And his front legs
were just long enough so that he could
reach his large, spade-like feet beyond his
nose and throw the dirt back. His fur
lay in one direction as easily as in another,
never troubling him in the least when he
was boring his way through the dry, loose
soil of Farmer Green's garden.</p>

<p>So in spite of what might seem great
drawbacks to others, Grandfather Mole
was contented with his lot. The only
thing he was ever known to grumble about
was the scarcity of angleworms.</p>

<h3>WHAT THE CAT CAUGHT</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> knew the cat at Farmer
Green's to be a great hunter. She had
long since disposed of the last mouse that
was so foolish as to venture inside her
home. And being very big, and not at all
timid, she had made such a name for herself
in the neighborhood that even the rats
looked on her as a monster to be avoided.</p>

<p>Now it often happened that this capable
cat turned up her nose at the saucer of
milk that Farmer Green's wife set before
her with great regularity. And off she
would go&mdash;sometimes to the barn, sometimes
to the fields&mdash;to see what she could<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_6" id="p_6">p. 6</a></span>
find that would furnish her both food and
a frolic. For she thought it great sport
to capture some small creature.</p>

<p>She was crossing the garden early one
morning, on her way to the meadow, when
she came upon Grandfather Mole. And
having no pity for him&mdash;in spite of his
blindness&mdash;she thought there was no sense
in going any further for her breakfast.
She would enjoy it right there in the garden.
But first she would play with Grandfather
Mole, before eating. For she was
a pleasure-loving dame. She must have
her sport, no matter if her breakfast
waited.</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole had blundered that
morning. Burrowing his way just under
the surface of the ground, he had broken
through the sun-baked crust of the garden
before he knew it. And as he groped
about, surprised to find himself in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_7" id="p_7">p. 7</a></span>
open, Miss Kitty had pounced upon him.</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole struggled to escape.
And his captor let him go, to give herself
the pleasure of pouncing upon him again.
She knew well enough that he couldn't get
away from her. He could run quite spryly
for an old gentleman&mdash;it is true. But
when he couldn't see where he was going,
of what use was running?</p>

<p>Farmer Green's cat didn't know the answer
to that question herself. She captured
and freed Grandfather Mole several
times. And to tell the truth, she couldn't
help wishing he could see, so he could make
the game livelier. But she was the sort
of cat that believes in making the best of
things. And she kept pretending that
Grandfather Mole almost got away from
her. She would let him run about for a
few moments and then she would leap
upon him as if she had nearly lost him.</p>

<p><a name="i-002" id="i-002"></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_8" id="p_8">p. 8</a></span>It was great fun for the cat. But
Grandfather Mole did not enjoy it in the
least. He thought such treatment far
from neighborly. And he quite agreed
with old Mr. Crow, who had come hurrying
up to see what was going on.</p>

<p>"Give him a chance! Give him a
chance!" Mr. Crow called to the cat, as he
glared down at her from a tree close by.</p>

<p>The cat had been about to spring at
Grandfather Mole again when Mr. Crow
spoke to her. It was only natural that she
should pause and turn her head. And she
looked at Mr. Crow none too pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I'll thank you to mind your own affairs,"
she said, and her voice was not
nearly so polite as her words. "No gentleman
would interrupt a lady at her
breakfast," she added.</p>

<p>Something seemed to amuse Mr. Crow,
for he laughed loudly. The cat didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_9" id="p_9">p. 9</a></span>
know what he was laughing at. And after
staring at him a few moments longer she
turned her head to look at Grandfather
Mole.</p>

<p>It wasn't more than ten seconds since
she had taken her eyes off him. But
Grandfather Mole had vanished.</p>

<h3>A BREAKFAST LOST</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Farmer Green's cat looked around
and discovered that Grandfather Mole
had disappeared from the garden a puzzled
look came over her face. She couldn't
think where he had gone in just a few seconds.</p>

<p>But she knew then why Mr. Crow
had laughed. And she was not pleased.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she asked Mr. Crow.
"You interrupted me at my breakfast and
now I've lost it."</p>

<p>Mr. Crow was rocking back and forth
on his perch, for a joke&mdash;on anybody except
himself&mdash;always delighted him.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_11" id="p_11">p. 11</a></span>"Grandfather Mole is right here in the
garden," he declared.</p>

<p>"Then he must have hidden beneath a
vegetable," the cat observed.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't say that, exactly," Mr.
Crow replied.</p>

<p>"How far away is he?" the cat demanded.</p>

<p>"That would be hard to tell," Mr. Crow
answered.</p>

<p>Farmer Green's cat had never liked Mr.
Crow, for no particular reason. And now
she certainly had a very special reason for
being angry with him.</p>

<p>"It's all your fault," she scolded. "If
you hadn't spoken to me I'd never have
taken my eyes off Grandfather Mole....
The least you can do," she added, "is to
tell me this instant where Grandfather
Mole is."</p>

<p>"I've already told you," Mr. Crow re<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_12" id="p_12">p. 12</a></span>minded
her. "He's here in the garden.
Find him if you can!"</p>

<p>At that Farmer Green's cat began to
run up and down between the rows of
vegetables. But she had no luck at all.
So after a while she came back and told
Mr. Crow that she didn't believe him.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said Mr. Crow. "You
haven't looked in the right place."</p>

<p>"I've searched the whole garden!" the
cat cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" Mr. Crow exclaimed.
"You've looked only on top of the ground.
If you want to find Grandfather Mole you
must look beneath the surface."</p>

<p>The cat was greatly disappointed when
she heard that.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that he went
into a hole, do you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do," Mr. Crow declared.</p>

<p>"I don't see one anywhere," she said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_13" id="p_13">p. 13</a></span></p>

<p>"If I had I'd have been more careful how
I let him run about."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Crow. "I see you don't
know that Grandfather Mole always carries
a hole around with him, wherever he
goes. He believes in having one handy,
in case of sudden need."</p>

<p>"I didn't see it," the cat told him angrily.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" Mr. Crow agreed.
"How could you see a hole until it's put in
a certain place, ready to use?"</p>

<p>Well, the cat was puzzled. Somehow
she couldn't quite understand Mr. Crow's
remarks. And yet there seemed some
sense in them, too. But she pretended that
she understood, because she didn't want
him to think she was stupid. And without
thanking him for his explanation (for she
was still angry) she turned and went off
towards the meadow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_14" id="p_14">p. 14</a></span>The whole affair amused Mr. Crow
greatly. It kept him in a good humor all
that day. And he went about telling
everybody how Grandfather Mole had dug
himself out of sight in the garden, almost
under the cat's nose.</p>

<p>For that was exactly what had happened.</p>

<h3>A NEW WAY OF TAKING A STROLL</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Grandfather Mole</span> was digging a new
gallery under the garden, leading out from
his house into a field of corn, where he
expected to find a good many fine grubs.</p>

<p>His work was half done, and he was
under the cabbage-patch, when he found
himself in the open air. Farmer Green's
hired man's hoe had left a small hollow
between two heads of cabbage; and as luck
had it, Grandfather Mole's gallery led
straight into it. So the first thing he
knew, there he was right out in the light
of early morning! And somebody called
out in a cheery sort of voice, "How-dy-do,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_16" id="p_16">p. 16</a></span>
Grandfather Mole! It's a pleasure to see
you! And isn't this a beautiful day?"</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole knew at once that he
had nothing to fear, for he recognized
Jimmy Rabbit's voice. And he knew, too,
without being told, that he was in the cabbage-patch.
For Jimmy Rabbit could be
nowhere else at breakfast time.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" said Grandfather
Mole. "I hope you are enjoying your
breakfast."</p>

<p>"I am," Jimmy Rabbit answered.
"And as soon as I've finished this leaf I'm
eating now, I'm going to take a stroll.
Won't you join me?"</p>

<p>"I don't care if I do," said Grandfather
Mole&mdash;meaning that he'd be glad
to walk with Jimmy. And in about half
a minute Jimmy Rabbit said he was ready.</p>

<p>"Very well!" Grandfather Mole told
him. "Let's be on our way! I'll see you<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_17" id="p_17">p. 17</a></span>
at the edge of the duck-pond." And to
Jimmy Rabbit's amazement he stuck his
nose straight down into the loose dirt,
thrust out his strong fore-feet, and was
out of sight before Jimmy Rabbit could
speak.</p>

<p>The duck-pond was just beyond the garden
fence. And since Grandfather Mole
had accepted Jimmy's invitation there
was nothing for Jimmy Rabbit to do but
to go to the edge of the pond and wait.</p>

<p>He grew very restless, for it was a long
time before Grandfather Mole appeared.
But at last the old gentleman's head came
popping up out of the ground, and the
owner of the head cried, "Here I am!
And I'm glad to see you haven't kept me
waiting, young man. I dug so fast I was
afraid I'd get here before you did."</p>

<p>Really, he had made astonishing speed
for one who had tunnelled his way under<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_18" id="p_18">p. 18</a></span>ground.
And being a polite person,
Jimmy Rabbit could only tell Grandfather
Mole that he had been very quick.</p>

<p>"And now we're this far," Grandfather
Mole remarked, "I'd like to stroll over in
the meadow&mdash;if that suits you."</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit said that it did. There
was clover in the meadow. And he had
waited so long for Grandfather Mole that
he had begun to feel hungry again. A
luncheon of clover-tops! It would be exactly
what he needed.</p>

<p>"Then let's be on our way!" Grandfather
Mole cried again. "I'll join you
on the other side of the duck-pond!"</p>

<h3>JIMMY RABBIT CAN'T WAIT</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> telling Jimmy Rabbit that he would
meet him on the other side of the duck-pond,
Grandfather Mole waded into the
water and started to swim across.</p>

<p>Why he did that, instead of walking
around on the shore, Jimmy Rabbit
couldn't understand. He was so amazed
that he stood still and stared at Grandfather
Mole.</p>

<p>One thing was certain: Grandfather
Mole could travel much faster through the
water than he could underground. His
strong legs and his broad, spade-like feet
helped to make him a fine swimmer. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_20" id="p_20">p. 20</a></span>
Jimmy Rabbit had noticed for the first
time that Grandfather Mole's hind feet
were webbed. It was no wonder that he
felt quite at home in the duck-pond, which
was made for web-footed folk.</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit was so interested in
watching Grandfather Mole swim that he
didn't start to run around the pond until
the swimmer had almost reached the other
side. Then Jimmy remembered suddenly
that he had to meet Grandfather Mole over
there. So he raced along the edge of the
duck-pond at top speed. And since he
was a very fast runner&mdash;for short distances&mdash;he
met Grandfather Mole just as
the old chap was crawling up the bank.</p>

<p>"There!" Grandfather Mole exclaimed.
"I almost beat you this time, young man!
If you're going to take a morning stroll
with me you'll have to step lively."</p>

<p>Of course Jimmy Rabbit was too polite<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_21" id="p_21">p. 21</a></span>
to explain that he had waited a long time
while Grandfather Mole was tunnelling
his way from the garden to the pond, and
that he hadn't begun to run around the
pond until Grandfather Mole had swum
almost across it. He merely smiled and
replied that he would do his best to keep
up, for he shouldn't like to make Grandfather
Mole wait, especially since he had
invited Grandfather Mole to go walking
with him.</p>

<p>"You don't mind staying here in the
sunshine, I hope, while my coat dries?"
Grandfather Mole inquired. "As soon as
it's dry we'll start for the meadow."</p>

<p>Though Jimmy Rabbit was in a great
hurry to reach the place where the clover
grew he said that he would be glad to wait
with Grandfather Mole. "The sun feels
good on this cool morning," he observed.
"And it's cheerful, too."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_22" id="p_22">p. 22</a></span>"Do you really think so?" Grandfather
Mole asked him. And when Jimmy Rabbit
assured him that he did, Grandfather
Mole muttered that it was the strangest
thing he ever heard of. As for him, he
much preferred the darkness of his cool,
damp galleries under the ground. And
the only reason why he wanted his coat to
dry was so that the dirt wouldn't stick to
it.</p>

<p>It seemed to Jimmy Rabbit that Grandfather
Mole's coat would never get dry
enough to suit the old gentleman. But at
last he announced that he was ready to
stroll on. And when Jimmy Rabbit cried
that he was ready, too, Grandfather Mole
said, "Then let's be on our way! And I'll
meet you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where the clover grows!" Jimmy interrupted.</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole had already buried<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_23" id="p_23">p. 23</a></span>
his nose in the sand and was fast digging
himself out of sight. And Jimmy thought
that if he must wait for him again he
would wait in a pleasant place.</p>

<p>So Jimmy Rabbit hurried to the meadow.
And as he lunched on luscious
clover-tops he reflected that Grandfather
Mole had a queer notion of taking a stroll
with a friend. He made up his mind then
and there that he would never again invite
Grandfather Mole to walk with him.</p>

<h3>A HEARTY EATER</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">great</span> eater was Grandfather Mole. And
having an enormous appetite he was fortunate
in being expert at finding angleworms.</p>

<p>To be sure, he had one advantage that
the birds, for instance, didn't enjoy: he
was able to prowl about his galleries
through the ground and find the angleworms
right where they lived. He didn't
need to wait&mdash;as the birds did&mdash;until an
angleworm stuck his head above ground.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jolly Robin had often wished&mdash;when
she was trying to feed a rapidly-growing
family&mdash;that she could hunt for<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_25" id="p_25">p. 25</a></span>
angleworms as Grandfather Mole did.
And this summer it seemed to her that she
never would be able to take proper care
of her nestful of children.</p>

<p>There was one of her family in particular
that was especially greedy. Mrs.
Robin had begun to suspect that he was
no child of hers, but a young Cowbird.
Almost as soon as she had finished building
her nest she had discovered a strange-looking
egg there. It had been the first to
hatch. And now the youngster that came
from it was just enough older than the
rest of her children to jostle them, and to
grab the biggest worms for himself.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that Mrs. Robin
needed help. And seeing Grandfather
Mole one morning, she explained her
difficulty to him, asking if he wouldn't
be so kind as to capture angleworms for
her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_26" id="p_26">p. 26</a></span>"Why, certainly! Certainly!" said
Grandfather Mole.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Robin breathed a sigh of relief.
She felt that her troubles were
ended.</p>

<p>"Will you begin to help me at once?"
she asked Grandfather Mole.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry that I can't do that," he told
her. "You see, I haven't had my breakfast
yet. So of course I must catch a few
angleworms for myself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Robin was a bit disappointed. But
she told Grandfather Mole that it was all
right&mdash;that she knew a person of his age
ought not to go without his breakfast.</p>

<p>So Grandfather Mole went back into the
hole through which he had lately come up,
first saying however that he would return
after he had breakfasted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robin then set to work herself, to
find what she could to feed her clamoring<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_27" id="p_27">p. 27</a></span>
family. Though she hurried as fast as
she could, by the time the morning was
almost half gone her children were still
hungry; and to Mrs. Robin's distress
Grandfather Mole had not yet showed himself
again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robin had been watching for him.
And she had about given him up in despair
when all at once he rose out of the
ground.</p>

<p>"Good!" she cried. "Now you can help
me, for you must have had your breakfast
by this time."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have!" said Grandfather Mole.
"I've just finished. But I always begin
my luncheon at this hour. So if you don't
mind I'll go down into my galleries and
hunt for a few angleworms; and when I've
had a good meal I'll come back here."</p>

<p>Well, what could Mrs. Robin say? She
nodded her head; and she hoped, as Grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_28" id="p_28">p. 28</a></span>father
Mole vanished, that perhaps he
would eat only a light luncheon.</p>

<p>But he never reappeared until mid-afternoon.
And since he announced then
that he was ready to begin his dinner Mrs.
Jolly Robin saw that she could expect no
help from him whatsoever.</p>

<p>She was terribly upset. But there was
nothing she could do except to tell her
husband that he would have to spend all
his time catching angleworms for the family.
And since he was glad enough to do
that, Mrs. Robin managed to feed her children
all they needed. Even the young
Cowbird in her nest had all he wanted.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Robin remarked that it was
lucky her husband hadn't such a terrible
appetite as some people's&mdash;meaning
Grandfather Mole's, of course.</p>

<h3>TWO WORM-EATERS</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> was one special reason&mdash;among
others&mdash;why Grandfather Mole didn't
like to show himself above ground in the
daytime. This reason was&mdash;hawks! And
there was something else that made him
dislike to appear at night, too. This
something else was&mdash;owls!</p>

<p>But of the two, Grandfather Mole disliked
hawks the more, because they could
see so far, while he (poor old fellow!)
couldn't even see the end of his own nose,
though goodness knows it was long
enough! Since Henry Hawk could sit in
a great elm far up the road and see him<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_30" id="p_30">p. 30</a></span>
the moment he stuck his head out of the
ground, while Grandfather Mole couldn't
even see the tree, it was not surprising that
Grandfather Mole preferred to stay below
while Henry Hawk was awake and on
watch.</p>

<p>Down in his galleries and chambers
where it was dark as a pocket Grandfather
Mole enjoyed himself thoroughly. It was
lucky he was fond of worms and grubs. If
he hadn't been it would be hard to say
what he could have found to eat&mdash;unless it
was dirt. There was plenty of that where
he spent his time. But luckily he didn't
have to eat it. He did enjoy digging in it,
however. So it is easy to see that the way
he lived suited him perfectly.</p>

<p>Not every one, of course, would have
felt as Grandfather Mole did about angleworms,
and grubs and dirt, or dampness,
or the dark. Many of his bird neighbors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_31" id="p_31">p. 31</a></span>
for instance, liked the same things to eat
that he did. But most of them&mdash;except
such odd ones as Solomon Owl, and Mr.
Nighthawk, and Willie Whip-poor-will&mdash;loved
the bright sunshine.</p>

<p>Spending a summer in Pleasant Valley
was a small gentleman of the well
known Warbler family, who had so great
a liking for worms that he was known as
the Worm-eating Warbler. This tiny
person spent little or none of his time in
the tree-tops, but chose to stay near the
ground. And more than once he had seen
Grandfather Mole in Farmer Green's garden.
He had heard somehow of Grandfather
Mole's tastes and habits. And he
was inclined to believe that it was Grandfather
Mole that was to blame for the
scarcity of worms in the neighborhood. It
must be confessed that he felt none too
kindly towards Grandfather Mole. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_32" id="p_32">p. 32</a></span>
thought that it would be a good thing if
somebody could persuade that odd, old
chap to stay on top of the ground, instead
of lurking most of the time down below
where he could catch the worms right
where they lived.</p>

<p>And one day the Worm-eating Warbler
spoke to Grandfather Mole when he happened
to see him come out of a hole.</p>

<p>"Why don't you live up here where you
can get plenty of fresh air and sunshine?"
he asked. "Don't you know they'd be
good for your health?"</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole turned his head toward
the speaker. That was as near as he
could come to staring at him, since he
couldn't see him. Grandfather Mole did
not like the Worm-eating Warbler's remarks
in the least!</p>

<p>"Why don't you"&mdash;he inquired&mdash;"why
don't you come down into the ground and<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_33" id="p_33">p. 33</a></span>
enjoy the close, damp air and the darkness?
They'd be good for your health.
I've thrived down below all my life; and
I'm considerably older than you, young
sir!"</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole's retort struck the
Worm-eating Warbler dumb. He could
think of nothing more to say. So he flew
off and hid in some raspberry bushes.
And he couldn't help saying to himself
what a strange world it was and what
strange persons there were in it.</p>

<h3>LOSING HIS BEARINGS</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> often happened, when Grandfather
Mole came up from his home under
Farmer Green's garden, that he turned
straight around and went back again.
Sometimes, to be sure, he ran about a bit
in a bewildered way, before he disappeared.
For he never felt at home in the
world above; and he was always uneasy
until he felt the darkness closing in
around him.</p>

<p>So nobody thought it strange when
Grandfather Mole came tumbling up
amongst the turnips one day and began
running blindly around the garden, zig<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_35" id="p_35">p. 35</a></span>-zagging
in every direction. Nobody that
saw him paid much attention to him. But
at last Rusty Wren, who had come to the
garden to look for worms, noticed that
Grandfather Mole was quite upset over
something. He didn't seem to have any
notion of going back into the ground, but
kept twisting this way and that, with his
long nose turning here and turning there,
in a manner that was unmistakably inquiring.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Rusty Wren
finally asked him, for his curiosity soon
got the better of him.</p>

<p>But Grandfather Mole didn't appear
to hear. Perhaps he didn't want to answer
the question.</p>

<p>"Have you lost something?" Rusty
Wren cried.</p>

<p>But Grandfather Mole never stopped
to reply. He never stopped running to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_36" id="p_36">p. 36</a></span>
and fro. And Rusty Wren became more
curious than ever. It was plain, to him,
that something unusual was afoot. And
he wanted to know what it was. "Can't
I help you?" he asked in his shrillest tones,
flying close to Grandfather Mole and
speaking almost in his ear&mdash;only Grandfather
Mole had no ears, so far as Rusty
Wren could see. "Can't I help you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you can!" Grandfather Mole answered
at last. "If you wish to help me,
for pity's sake go away and keep still! I
don't want the whole neighborhood to
come a-running. The cat will be here the
first thing we know."</p>

<p>Rusty Wren felt sure, then, that Grandfather
Mole was in trouble. And if he was
worried about Farmer Green's cat, why
didn't he dig a hole for himself at once,
and get out of harm's way?</p>

<p>Since Rusty Wren didn't know, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_37" id="p_37">p. 37</a></span>
asked Grandfather Mole&mdash;in little more
than a whisper. But Grandfather Mole
only shook his head impatiently, as if to
say that digging a hole wouldn't help him
this time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile some of Rusty Wren's
friends had come up to see what was going
on. And talking in low tones, so that
they wouldn't attract the cat's attention,
they agreed with him that there was some
mystery about Grandfather Mole. But
not one of them knew what it could be.</p>

<p>"He's lost something!" Rusty Wren declared.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt of that," Jolly Robin
chimed in.</p>

<p>"What can it be?" little Mr. Chippy
piped in his thin voice.</p>

<p>"I know!" Rusty Wren exclaimed
abruptly. "It's his bearings! Grandfather
Mole has lost his bearings!"</p>

<h3>GOOD NEWS FROM BELOW</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Rusty Wren decided that Grandfather
Mole had lost his bearings and
that that was the reason why he was running
about the garden in a most peculiar
fashion, the rest of the birds began to
wonder whether they oughtn't to help
Grandfather Mole find them, since he was
blind.</p>

<p>The Worm-eating Warbler, however,
who was none too friendly towards Grandfather
Mole, said that he had his doubts
as to Grandfather Mole's blindness.</p>

<p>"If he can find angleworms in the dark
he certainly ought to be able to find his<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_39" id="p_39">p. 39</a></span>
bearings in broad daylight," he sneered.</p>

<p>But Rusty Wren pointed out that nobody
could <i>see</i> bearings, anyhow&mdash;a remark
that puzzled the Worm-eating
Warbler more than a little. To tell the
truth, he had no idea what bearings were.
And at last he admitted that he didn't
know.</p>

<p>"What are bearings, anyhow?" he
asked Rusty Wren. "I don't understand
what you mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, I mean that Grandfather Mole
has lost his way," Rusty Wren explained.
"He doesn't know how to get home."</p>

<p>The Worm-eating Warbler asked why
Grandfather Mole didn't dig a new hole
for himself, if he had lost the one he used
when he came up in the garden. And
when he saw that Rusty Wren couldn't
answer his question the Worm-eating
Warbler said he had his doubts as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_40" id="p_40">p. 40</a></span>
Rusty Wren's ideas about Grandfather
Mole.</p>

<p>"It's my opinion," he went on, "that
Grandfather Mole has eaten all the worms
that lived in the ground; and now he's
hoping to find some in the air."</p>

<p>Although everybody laughed at such a
notion, the Worm-eating Warbler declared
that he had a right to his own belief.
And when he added that he hadn't
seen an angleworm for two days there
were a few of his bird companions that
began to think perhaps there was some
reason in his remarks, after all.</p>

<p>But Rusty Wren declined to change his
opinion.</p>

<p>"There's only one way to be sure; and
that's to ask Grandfather Mole!" little
Mr. Chippy cried.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do any good," Rusty told
him. "Grandfather Mole won't answer<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_41" id="p_41">p. 41</a></span>
any questions. But he's in some sort of
trouble. There's no doubt of that."</p>

<p>They looked down at Grandfather Mole,
who was still scurrying frantically about
the garden. If he heard their talk he did
nothing to let them know it. And they had
begun to think that they would never know
his secret when a person who looked somewhat
like Grandfather Mole thrust her
head and shoulders out of a hole in the
ground.</p>

<p>"That"&mdash;Rusty Wren whispered&mdash;"that
is Grandfather Mole's daughter. I
know, for I've seen her before." And listening
sharply, the bird people heard her
say, "Don't worry, Father! I've found
them."</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole didn't wait for anything
more. He didn't even wait until
he had found the opening in which his
daughter had appeared. He began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_42" id="p_42">p. 42</a></span>
dig right where he stood. And he was
out of sight in short order.</p>

<p>Although the bird people didn't know
it, he was anxious to reach his grandchildren.
He had them out for a stroll through
his underground galleries; and walking
behind him they had taken a wrong turn
when Grandfather Mole didn't know it.
After looking for them in vain down below
he had feared that they might have
found their way into the open air. And
that was why he was running about in
such a distracted fashion.</p>

<h3>MRS. ROBIN'S WISH</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> order to provide enough food for her
children&mdash;as well as for the young Cowbird
that she was bringing up&mdash;Mrs. Jolly
Robin had to work hard every day.
Though her husband gladly did what he
could to help her, he complained sometimes
about the stranger in their nest.</p>

<p>"Our family is certainly big enough
without him," he often remarked. "We
ought to turn him out to shift for himself."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Robin wouldn't hear of such
a thing.</p>

<p>"It's not his fault that his mother left<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_44" id="p_44">p. 44</a></span>
him here&mdash;in the egg," she would remind
Jolly Robin. "If we set him adrift the
poor child would starve&mdash;unless the cat
got him."</p>

<p>And then Jolly Robin would feel
ashamed that he had even thought of being
so cruel to an infant bird, even if he
was a Cowbird. So he would set to work
harder than ever gathering worms and
grubs and bugs; and before long he would
find himself singing merrily, "Cheerily,
cheer-up!" because it made him happy to
know that he was doing somebody a good
turn.</p>

<p>Once in a while Grandfather Mole
thrust his head out of the soil of the garden,
as if he were watching Mr. and Mrs.
Robin at their task. Of course he
couldn't see what they were doing. But
Mrs. Robin said that it gave her a queer
turn to have Grandfather Mole stick his<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_45" id="p_45">p. 45</a></span>
nose out of the ground at her very feet.
And since he was too busy catching angleworms
for himself to help her and her
husband, she wished he would keep out of
sight.</p>

<p>Sometimes Grandfather Mole would
speak to Mrs. Robin, or her husband; for
he could hear them talking. And when
you hear anybody in a garden exclaiming,
"Oh, here's a big one! The children will
like him, if I can ever pull him loose!"
you may know at once that the speaker
is talking about an angleworm. There
can be no mistake about it.</p>

<p>When Grandfather Mole overheard
Mrs. Robin making such a remark he
would quite likely advise her to "try a
smaller one."</p>

<p>Such a suggestion only made Mrs.
Robin pull all the harder.</p>

<p>"Grandfather Mole wants all the big<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_46" id="p_46">p. 46</a></span>
ones himself," she would splutter as soon
as she and her husband were where
Grandfather Mole couldn't listen to what
she said. And then, probably, Jolly Robin
would laugh and tell her not to mind, for
there ought to be worms enough for everybody.</p>

<p>More than once, when Grandfather
Mole had advised her to "try a smaller
one," Mrs. Robin had declared afterward
that she wished she could catch the biggest
angleworm in the whole garden, just
to spite old Grandfather Mole and teach
him that other people had their rights, as
well as he.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" Jolly Robin always exclaimed
with a laugh. "Well, well! Perhaps
some day you will find the grandfather
of all the angleworms!"</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<h3>SURPRISING GRANDFATHER<br />MOLE</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Somehow</span> Grandfather Mole heard that
Mrs. Robin hoped to capture the biggest
angleworm in the garden. So the very
next time he happened to find her at work
there he offered her another bit of unsought
advice. And Mrs. Robin liked it
no better than any other of Grandfather
Mole's counsels.</p>

<p>"Don't waste your valuable time looking
for the biggest angleworm in the garden!"
he told her. "I've caught him already."</p>

<p>Well, for once Mrs. Robin almost said
something tart to the old gentleman. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_48" id="p_48">p. 48</a></span>
she checked herself in time; not by biting
her tongue, however, but by clapping her
bill upon a fat bug that was trying to
hide under a potato-top. And away she
flew to her nest, leaving Grandfather
Mole to talk to the air, if he wished.</p>

<p>"She went off without thanking me,"
he muttered. To be sure, he hadn't seen
Mrs. Robin go, but he had heard the beat
of her wings as she began her flight. He
didn't know that he had barely escaped a
sharp scolding.</p>

<p>"What do you think Grandfather Mole
has just said to me?" Mrs. Robin asked
her husband, whom she found at the nest
feeding their children.</p>

<p>Jolly Robin made three guesses. But
none of them was right. So his wife repeated
Grandfather Mole's remarks. And
as usual Jolly Robin laughed.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't pay any attention to what<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_49" id="p_49">p. 49</a></span>
Grandfather Mole says," he advised his
wife. "I should keep an eye out for big
angleworms, if I were you. Grandfather
Mole may be mistaken. He may have
caught only the second biggest one."</p>

<p>What her husband said made Mrs.
Robin feel better. And she declared that
she would surprise Grandfather Mole yet.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the very next day
Grandfather Mole spoke to Mrs. Robin
again and told her that "there was no
use trying to surprise him, so she needn't
waste her valuable time trying to do it."</p>

<p>This news made Mrs. Robin quite
speechless. She couldn't think how
Grandfather Mole had happened to learn
of her remark, unless her husband had
been gossiping with his friends. And if
that was the case, Mrs. Robin didn't mean
to let anything of the kind occur again.
So she went on searching for her chil<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_50" id="p_50">p. 50</a></span>dren's
breakfast and said nothing to any
one about Grandfather Mole's latest bit of
advice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robin worked harder than ever
that day. It seemed to her husband that
she had eyes for nothing but worms. Certainly
she paid little attention to him. So
he couldn't help feeling pleased when she
called to him toward evening.</p>

<p>He flew quickly to her side. And he
saw at once that she needed his help. For
Mrs. Robin had an end of a pinkish-white
worm in her bill, on which she was tugging
as hard as she could.</p>

<p>"I think it's the biggest one in the garden!"
she managed to gasp. "But it simply
won't come up out of the ground."</p>

<p>"It must be the grandfather of them
all!" Jolly Robin cried. And laying hold
of the worm himself, he pulled with her.</p>

<p>Somehow there seemed a great commo<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_51" id="p_51">p. 51</a></span>tion
in the loose dirt at their feet, as they
struggled to get the worm out of its hiding-place.
And at last, to their great delight,
they felt it&mdash;saw it&mdash;coming.</p>

<p>Then a shower of dirt flew into their
faces and both Jolly Robin and his wife
tumbled over backward.</p>

<p>It was no worm that Mrs. Robin had
found, but Grandfather Mole's hairless
tail sticking out of the ground. Together
they had dragged him to the surface.</p>

<p>And if Mrs. Robin hadn't found the
grandfather of all angleworms, at least
she had found Grandfather Mole.</p>

<p>And she had given him a surprise, too.</p>

<h3>MR. BLACKBIRD'S ADVICE</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Out</span> of the pine woods beyond the meadow
Mr. Blackbird sometimes came to breakfast
in Farmer Green's garden. He
claimed that he came there to look for
angleworms. But those that knew him
best said that he wasn't above taking an
egg out of some small bird's nest. And
some whispered that he had even been
known to devour a nestling.</p>

<p>Whenever he visited the garden he told
everybody that he should never come there
again because Grandfather Mole was too
greedy. Mr. Blackbird said that Grandfather
Mole didn't leave enough angle<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_53" id="p_53">p. 53</a></span>worms
to make it worth his while to fly
across the meadow. And one day when
he chanced to meet Grandfather Mole he
told him that it was a shame, the way he
was treating Farmer Green.</p>

<p>"Farmer Green is good enough to let
you live underneath his garden. But instead
of showing him that you are grateful
you eat all of his angleworms you can."</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole was thunderstruck.
After pondering over Mr. Blackbird's
speech for a few moments he raised his
head. "What shall I do?" he asked in a
plaintive voice.</p>

<p>"I should think you'd turn over a new
leaf," Mr. Blackbird told him severely.</p>

<p>And Grandfather Mole promised that
he would.</p>

<p>"I'll turn one over to-day," he said, "if
you think it will please Farmer Green."</p>

<p>"There's no doubt that it will," Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_54" id="p_54">p. 54</a></span>
Blackbird assured him in a slightly more
amiable tone.</p>

<p>A hopeful look came into Grandfather
Mole's face. And after thanking Mr.
Blackbird for his advice, he turned away
and burrowed out of sight.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Blackbird selected a good
many choice tidbits here and there, which
he bolted with gusto. And after he had
eaten what Jolly Robin, who had been
watching him, declared afterward to have
been a hearty meal and big enough for
any one, Mr. Blackbird began to scold.
He announced that there wasn't any use
of his looking for anything more to eat
in that neighborhood, for there wasn't
enough there to keep a mosquito alive.
And thereupon he flew away. Nor was
anybody sorry to see him go.</p>

<p>Most of the feathered folk agreed that
Mr. Blackbird ought not to have spoken<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_55" id="p_55">p. 55</a></span>
as he did to Grandfather Mole. But Jolly
Robin's wife said that she was glad there
was somebody with backbone enough to
tell Grandfather Mole the truth.</p>

<p>"If there were many more like Grandfather
Mole in the garden we'd all have to
spend our summers somewhere else," she
said, "or starve."</p>

<p>Jolly Robin told her that she would find
things much the same, no matter where
she lived. "What's a garden, without an
old mole or two?" he asked the company
in general. And since nobody answered,
Jolly Robin seemed to think he had silenced
Mrs. Robin&mdash;for once.</p>

<p>But it was not so.</p>

<p>"A garden without an old mole in it
would be just what I'd like," she cried.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, my dear," her husband
said, "please remember that Grandfather
Mole is going to turn over a new leaf."</p>

<h3>TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Several</span> days passed before Mr. Blackbird
returned to Farmer Green's garden.
And when at last he flew across the meadow
one morning and perched on the garden
fence, to take a look around before
beginning his breakfast, he saw that Mrs.
Jolly Robin was making countless trips
between the garden and her home. Early
as it was she was hard at work feeding
her nestlings.</p>

<p>"How are the pickings this morning?"
Mr. Blackbird called to her.</p>

<p>"I'm finding plenty for my children to
eat&mdash;if that's what you mean," Mrs. Robin<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_57" id="p_57">p. 57</a></span>
replied somewhat haughtily. Mr. Blackbird
laughed in the sleeve of his black coat.
The rascal delighted in using language
that did not please Mrs. Robin.</p>

<p>"If the pickings are good, then there
must be fewer pickers," he remarked with
a grin. "I suppose Grandfather Mole
has taken my advice and turned over a
new leaf."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Mrs.
Robin. "Anyhow, there are plenty of
good crawling things stirring after last
night's shower. Everything seems to be
coming up out of the garden this morning."</p>

<p>She had scarcely finished speaking
when Grandfather Mole poked his head
from beneath a head of lettuce. Mr.
Blackbird was just about to begin his
breakfast. But he paused when he saw
Grandfather Mole.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_58" id="p_58">p. 58</a></span>"Hello!" he cried. "What brings you
to the surface?"</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole knew Mr. Blackbird's
voice at once.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're here!" he exclaimed.
"I want you to tell Farmer Green the
news. For I know he'll be delighted to
hear it."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Blackbird did an ungentlemanly
thing. He winked at Jolly Robin's
wife. But he was a rowdy. So what could
you expect of him?</p>

<p>"You've turned over a new leaf, have
you?" he asked Grandfather Mole.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Grandfather Mole. "And
not only one! I've turned over a new one
every day since I last saw you."</p>

<p>Mr. Blackbird replied that he was glad
to know it.</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%; text-align: right">(<a href="#i-003"><i>Page</i> 61</a>)</p>
</div>

<p>"At least," Grandfather Mole continued,
"I've turned over the newest<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_59" id="p_59">p. 59</a></span>
leaves I could. Of course you can't turn
over a leaf unless it's big enough to turn
over. When a leaf is so young that it
wraps itself around the main stalk it's
useless to try to turn it over. And it's a
great waste of time waiting for it to grow....
But it's easy to turn over a big one."
Suiting his action to his words, Grandfather
Mole stepped up to a loose-growing
head of lettuce, and thrusting his long nose
under a drooping leaf he lifted it up and
pushed it over.</p>

<p>As soon as he moved aside a little the
leaf promptly righted itself. Grandfather
Mole felt it brush his back as it swept into
place again.</p>

<p>"Of course," he remarked, "you can't
expect a leaf to stay turned over, unless
you want to stand and hold it in place.
And that would be a great waste of time&mdash;especially
for one as hungry as I am."<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_60" id="p_60">p. 60</a></span>
And poking his drill-like snout into the
earth, he drew forth a huge angleworm,
which quickly disappeared down his
throat.</p>

<p>Mr. Blackbird choked; and not over
anything he was eating, either. He choked
because he was angry.</p>

<p>"It's no use," he said gloomily to Mrs.
Robin, as soon as he could speak. "It's
no use trying to get Grandfather Mole to
stop eating angleworms. In my opinion,
he's too old to turn over a new leaf&mdash;the
way I meant.</p>

<p>"You can't teach an old Mole new
tricks," said Mr. Blackbird.</p>

<h3>THE NEW SUNSHADE</h3>


<p class="noindent"><a name="i-003" id="i-003"></a><span class="smcap">Grandfather Mole</span> was resting in the
shade of a toadstool. It was a stifling,
sultry day. And having come up into the
garden on some errand or other, Grandfather
Mole had found the sunshine upon
his back altogether too hot for his liking.</p>

<p>He was thinking how comfortable his
own cool, dark chambers were, and wondering
why anybody should prefer to live
above ground in the heat, when a voice
called to him, "What a fine umbrella you
have! It must be a handy thing to have in
one's family!"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Meadow Mouse speaking.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_62" id="p_62">p. 62</a></span>And since Grandfather Mole knew him to
be a harmless sort of person he asked him
to come over and join him.</p>

<p>"To be sure, there's not room enough
for two under my sunshade," Grandfather
Mole said. "But you can stand just outside
it. And perhaps the sight of me in
the shade may help you to feel cooler, even
if you are in the sun."</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Meadow Mouse smiled a bit,
all to himself. He knew that Grandfather
Mole was odd. And being a good-natured
person and wishing to please Grandfather
Mole, Mr. Meadow Mouse joined him.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it now?" Grandfather
Mole demanded of Mr. Meadow
Mouse, almost as soon as he had stepped
just outside the shade of the toadstool.
"Don't you feel cooler already? I
shouldn't care to stay in the garden a
second without this sunshade."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_63" id="p_63">p. 63</a></span>Mr. Meadow Mouse wanted to be polite.
So he replied that perhaps he did feel a
bit more comfortable.</p>

<p>"You ought to own one of these," said
Grandfather Mole.</p>

<p>"I've heard they're not always easy to
find," Mr. Meadow Mouse remarked.</p>

<p>"That's true," Grandfather agreed.</p>

<p>"You don't&mdash;ahem!&mdash;you don't use this
one all the time, do you?" Mr. Meadow
Mouse inquired.</p>

<p>"No!" Grandfather Mole answered.
"Not when it rains!"</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Meadow Mouse,
"maybe you'll let me borrow your umbrella
(or sunshade, as you call it) some
rainy day."</p>

<p>"Certainly! You shall take it the next
time it rains!" Grandfather promised.</p>

<p>As Mr. Meadow Mouse murmured,
"Thank you!" he looked up at the sky<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_64" id="p_64">p. 64</a></span>
with a knowing eye. He could see signs
there. But of course Grandfather Mole
had never seen the sky in all his life.</p>

<p>"The very next time it rains!" Mr.
Meadow Mouse repeated, as if he wanted
to be sure there was no misunderstanding
about it.</p>

<p>"Certainly! Certainly!" Grandfather
Mole said. "And as I've remarked before,
I'd be glad to let you come under
the sunshade now, beside me, if there was
only room enough for both of us."</p>

<p>"You needn't trouble yourself," Mr.
Meadow Mouse told him. And once more
he scanned the sky eagerly.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Grandfather Mole
cried suddenly, as he started up in alarm.
"What struck the top of my sunshade?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mr. Meadow
Mouse. "I don't know what it was, unless
it was a rain-drop."</p>

<h3>TWO AND A TOADSTOOL</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Grandfather Mole</span> had promised Mr.
Meadow Mouse that he would loan him
his toadstool sunshade&mdash;or umbrella&mdash;the
very next time it rained. But when he
agreed to that, Grandfather hadn't the
slightest idea there was a shower coming.
Mr. Meadow Mouse, however, had
watched the dark clouds gathering in the
sky. But he had said nothing of what he
saw. And when the rain-drops began to
patter on top of Grandfather Mole's sunshade
Mr. Meadow Mouse cried in a brisk
voice: "I'll thank you, sir, for the loan of
your umbrella!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_66" id="p_66">p. 66</a></span>Now, Grandfather Mole had never used
his umbrella until that very day. It was
not a quarter of an hour since he had discovered
it standing in the garden. And
when he had made his promise to Mr.
Meadow Mouse he had had no idea that
it was going to rain so soon. He didn't
like the thought of loaning a new umbrella
the first day he owned it.</p>

<p>"Can't you wait?" he asked Mr. Meadow
Mouse. "Wouldn't some other day
suit you just as well?"</p>

<p>But Mr. Meadow Mouse reminded him
that a promise was a promise.</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;can't you squeeze in beside
me?" Grandfather Mole asked him.</p>

<p>But Mr. Meadow Mouse said that he
didn't see how he could do that. "Now
that it rains there's no more room under
your umbrella than there was a few moments
ago, when the sun was shining."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_67" id="p_67">p. 67</a></span>"You're mistaken," said Grandfather
Mole.</p>

<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse looked surprised.
"I don't understand how that can be," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"This toadstool is growing bigger all
the time," Grandfather Mole explained.</p>

<p>"Very well!" said Mr. Meadow Mouse.
"If you think there's room for two, I'll
crowd in." As he spoke he wedged himself
between Grandfather Mole and the
stem of the toadstool umbrella. And immediately
Grandfather Mole found himself
out in the rain. The old gentleman
didn't like that very well; and he said as
much, too.</p>

<p>"It's plain that your umbrella didn't
grow as much as you thought," Mr. Meadow
Mouse retorted.</p>

<p>"You're mistaken," Grandfather Mole
told him once more. "My umbrella grew<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_68" id="p_68">p. 68</a></span>
exactly as much as I expected it would.
But there was one thing I forgot."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"You were growing at the same time,"
Grandfather Mole replied.</p>

<p>"Yes! And there's another thing that
you forgot!" Mr. Meadow Mouse exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I doubt it," said Grandfather Mole.
And though he didn't ask what it was, Mr.
Meadow Mouse told him.</p>

<p>"You were growing too!" he cried.</p>

<p>But Grandfather Mole couldn't agree
with Mr. Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>"I'm too old to grow any more," he said.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Mr. Meadow Mouse,
"but I don't see how a person with your
well known appetite can help growing fat.
And anyhow I'm sorry you're out in the
rain. But it's certainly not my fault."</p>

<p>"We won't discuss that," Grandfather<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_69" id="p_69">p. 69</a></span>
Mole told him. "And since I don't want
to get wet I'm going home.... I hope
you'll take good care of my new sunshade.
And please don't forget to return it!" he
added anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'll leave it right here for you," Mr.
Meadow Mouse promised.</p>

<p>Though Grandfather Mole was far from
satisfied he crawled into the ground and
left Mr. Meadow Mouse to enjoy the rain
pattering on the top of the toadstool. And
the next day, to his great relief, Grandfather
Mole found his sunshade in the
same spot. Mr. Meadow Mouse hadn't
taken it away. To tell the truth, he had
tried to; but he had found that he couldn't
move it. Grandfather Mole said it was the
first sunshade that a borrower had ever returned
to him.</p>

<p>And that was the truth. For he had
never owned a sunshade before.</p>

<h3>GRANDFATHER MOLE'S VISITOR</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> Grandfather Mole's neighbors
might say of him, they never could claim that
he was lazy. He was always busy.
When he wasn't eating or sleeping you
could be quite sure that he was digging.
He never seemed to be satisfied with his
house, but was forever making what he
called "improvements." If there was one
thing he liked, it was plenty of halls. He
had halls running in every direction. And
since a person could never tell in which
one Grandfather Mole might be, visitors
might roam about his dark galleries a long
time without finding him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_71" id="p_71">p. 71</a></span>If anybody happened to point out to
Grandfather Mole that his house had such
a drawback, Grandfather Mole always answered
that he liked his house just as it
was and that he wouldn't change it for
anything&mdash;except to add a few more halls.</p>

<p>He was very set in his ways. He
claimed that he wouldn't be comfortable
in a house that had maybe only two halls&mdash;a
front and a back one, as Billy Woodchuck's
dwelling was known to contain.</p>

<p>Maybe that was the reason why Grandfather
Mole never went visiting. And as
for anybody else visiting him&mdash;well, what
was the use when most likely you never
could find him?</p>

<p>Nevertheless there was one of Grandfather
Mole's neighbors who called at his
house frequently, and for the very reason
that he knew he could probably do exactly
as he pleased. Far from trying to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_72" id="p_72">p. 72</a></span>
Grandfather Mole, Mr. Meadow Mouse always
took pains to avoid him. And if by
chance he met Grandfather Mole in one of
his galleries Mr. Meadow Mouse was always
extremely polite&mdash;and ready to run
at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>During corn-planting time Mr. Meadow
Mouse went regularly down into a
gallery of Grandfather Mole's that ran
under a corner of the cornfield. And
somehow he soon grew quite plump.</p>

<p>Now, Grandfather Mole had met Mr.
Meadow Mouse two or three times in that
particular gallery. And he was not slow
to notice that his visitor looked fatter each
time he saw him. So one day Grandfather
Mole asked Mr. Meadow Mouse bluntly
what he was doing there.</p>

<p>"I'm taking a stroll!" Mr. Meadow
Mouse told him meekly.</p>

<p>"Be careful"&mdash;Grandfather Mole<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_73" id="p_73">p. 73</a></span>
warned him&mdash;"be careful that you don't
take anything else!"</p>

<p>Trembling slightly (for Grandfather
Mole could be terribly severe when he
wanted to be) Mr. Meadow Mouse said
that he hoped Grandfather Mole didn't
mind if a person took a little exercise now
and then in those underground halls. "On
a warm summer's day it's delightfully
cool down here," Mr. Meadow Mouse murmured.</p>

<p>His speech pleased Grandfather Mole.</p>

<p>"I'm glad there's some one that agrees
with me!" he exclaimed. "Most people
think I'm queer because I like to live
underground."</p>

<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse hastened to assure
him that <i>he</i> didn't think him queer&mdash;not
in the least!</p>

<p>"Thank you! Thank you!" Grandfather
Mole said. "And since you're a<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_74" id="p_74">p. 74</a></span>
person of more sense than I had supposed
you're welcome to ramble through my
halls&mdash;so long as you don't take anything
except exercise and a stroll."</p>

<p>Then it was Mr. Meadow Mouse's turn
to thank Grandfather Mole.</p>

<p>"I feel better," he said, "now that
you've given me permission to come here.
For to tell the truth, I've often felt that I
was taking a chance."</p>

<p>So matters went on smoothly for a time.
And Mr. Meadow Mouse spent hours in
the gallery under the cornfield. And he
grew fatter every day. Naturally he did
not take such pains to dodge Grandfather
Mole&mdash;after the talk they had had. And
when the two met one evening Grandfather
Mole stopped Mr. Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>"There's something I want to say to
you," he remarked. "I notice you're
looking extremely well-fed. And I hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_75" id="p_75">p. 75</a></span>
you're not eating any of my angleworms."</p>

<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse laughed right in
Grandfather Mole's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he replied.</p>

<p>"Nor any of my grubs or bugs?"
Grandfather Mole persisted.</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" said Mr. Meadow
Mouse, making a wry face as he spoke&mdash;for
he was rather a dainty person. And
then he whispered something to Grandfather
Mole.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Grandfather Mole. "So
that's it, eh? Well, I don't mind. I never
eat anything of that sort. Take all you
want of it!"</p>

<h3>MR. CROW SCOLDS</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Old</span> Mr. Crow was angry with Grandfather
Mole.</p>

<p>Now, there was nothing strange about
that, because Mr. Crow was always losing
his temper. And his neighbors had
long since learned not to pay much heed to
his scolding. They knew that loud talk
never really hurt any one. And generally
Mr. Crow forgot a grievance quickly, because
he was sure to get angry with somebody
else.</p>

<p>There was one matter upon which Mr.
Crow was especially touchy. That was
corn. If anybody talked about corn-rob<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_77" id="p_77">p. 77</a></span>bers,
or even said much about corn as a
food, Mr. Crow always lost his temper.
And if anybody showed much liking for
corn, or meddled in the cornfield, then old
Mr. Crow would get so angry that he
couldn't speak a pleasant word for days
and days.</p>

<p>And now he was enraged because he had
reason to believe that Grandfather Mole
was eating the corn that Farmer Green
had planted.</p>

<p>"He's eating it out of the hills," Mr.
Crow told his neighbors.</p>

<p>"Farmer Green sometimes places scarecrows
in the cornfield," Jimmy Rabbit remarked.
"So why wouldn't it be a good
idea to get him to set up a few scaremoles?"</p>

<p>"That wouldn't help any," Mr. Crow
said gloomily. Usually the merest mention
of a scarecrow sent him into a rage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_78" id="p_78">p. 78</a></span>
But now he was too angry with Grandfather
Mole to pick a quarrel with any one
else. "Grandfather Mole couldn't see a
scaremole if he ran head first into it," Mr.
Crow continued. "And besides, even if
he had eyes to see with, he's working
underground. Grandfather Mole has dug
galleries that run under the cornfield. And
he can get right inside a hill of corn and
gobble the seed corn without being seen."</p>

<p>"Then how do you know what Grandfather
Mole is doing, when you can't see
him?" Jimmy Rabbit inquired.</p>

<p>"The corn isn't coming up as it should,"
Mr. Crow told him. "So I scratched open
a hill myself, to find out what was the
matter."</p>

<p>"You didn't find Grandfather Mole, did
you?" Jimmy Rabbit cried.</p>

<p>"No!" said Mr. Crow. "And I found
no corn, either. But there was one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_79" id="p_79">p. 79</a></span>
Grandfather Mole's galleries leading up
to the center of the hill. So it's easy to
guess where the corn goes."</p>

<p>Since news always travels fast in Pleasant
Valley and tales such as Mr. Crow told
spread more rapidly than any other, it
wasn't long before Mrs. Robin repeated
Mr. Crow's remarks in Grandfather
Mole's hearing.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he called. "Please say
that again!"</p>

<p>"Old Mr. Crow claims that you are eating
Farmer Green's seed corn out of the
hills," Mrs. Robin said. And she had the
grace to grow somewhat red in the face,
because it was hardly the sort of thing to
say to an old gentleman like Grandfather
Mole.</p>

<p>For a few moments Grandfather Mole
was silent. He couldn't say a word for
himself. And Mrs. Robin whispered to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_80" id="p_80">p. 80</a></span>
some of her friends that it certainly looked
as if Grandfather Mole was guilty.</p>

<p>At last he managed to speak. But it
was a most peculiar question that he
asked; so far as Mrs. Robin could see, it
had absolutely nothing to do with the case:</p>

<p>"If you happen to see Mr. Meadow
Mouse, will you tell him that I'd like to
have a talk with him?"</p>



<hr class="chapter" /><p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_81" id="p_81">p. 81</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII</h2>

<h3>A TALK WITH MR. MEADOW<br />MOUSE</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> next time she saw Mr. Meadow Mouse
Mrs. Robin gave him Grandfather Mole's
message. "He says," said she, "he'd like
to have a talk with you."</p>

<p>"Does he?" Mr. Meadow Mouse exclaimed.
"Now I wonder what he has to
say! I returned his umbrella to him, after
the rain. So it can't be about that."</p>

<p>"If I wanted to know, I'd go and find
Grandfather Mole," Mrs. Robin suggested
tartly.</p>

<p>Being a mild sort of person, Mr. Meadow
Mouse thanked Mrs. Robin politely,
both for the message and for the advice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_82" id="p_82">p. 82</a></span>
And then, scampering to a certain spot
that he knew, near the fence, he disappeared
through an opening into the
ground. It was one of Grandfather
Mole's doorways. Mr. Meadow Mouse did
not hesitate to use it, being one of those
fortunate folk that are quite at home anywhere.
It made little difference to him
whether he was above the ground or in
it. And aside from Grandfather Mole and
his own family there was no one that knew
his way about Grandfather Mole's galleries
as well as Mr. Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>To be sure, he had some trouble in finding
the old gentleman, there were so many
different passages in which to look for
him. But at last Mr. Meadow Mouse met
Grandfather Mole in a long tunnel that
followed a row of newly planted corn.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" Grandfather Mole cried.
"There's something I want to say to you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_83" id="p_83">p. 83</a></span>"So I hear!" Mr. Meadow Mouse replied
a bit anxiously, for Grandfather
Mole sounded none too pleasant.</p>

<p>"You've been getting me into trouble
with old Mr. Crow," Grandfather Mole
complained. "He thinks I've been eating
the seed corn that Farmer Green planted.
And if I told him that it was you that's
done it, and that you've been using my
galleries to reach the hills of corn, Mr.
Crow would never believe what I said."</p>

<p>"It looks bad for you, doesn't it?" said
Mr. Meadow Mouse more cheerfully.</p>

<p>Somehow his remark displeased Grandfather
Mole.</p>

<p>"You'd better be careful what you say!"
he warned Mr. Meadow Mouse. "If you
make me angry it will go hard with you."</p>

<p>Now, Grandfather Mole was known to
be a terrible fighter when aroused. And
Mr. Meadow Mouse had no liking for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_84" id="p_84">p. 84</a></span>
fight with any one. So he moved backward
a few steps and made ready to run.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry if I have caused you
trouble," he said. "Couldn't you explain
to Mr. Crow that you have tunnelled into
the hills of corn in order to catch the grubs
that would eat the corn if you didn't eat
them first? Can't you tell him that you
are helping the corn crop, instead of ruining
it?"</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole shook his head.</p>

<p>"You're not much acquainted with Mr.
Crow," he replied. "If he has made up his
mind that I'm stealing corn nothing I
could say would change his opinion."</p>

<p>"Can't I help you in some way?" Mr.
Meadow Mouse asked. "I'd do almost
anything, because you've let me use your
galleries."</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole pondered for a
time.

<a name="i-001" id="i-001"></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_85" id="p_85">p. 85</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps there is a way you can help,"
he said at last. "If you'll manage somehow
to let Mr. Crow catch you in one of
these hills, with your mouth full of corn,
he'd know that you were the guilty party."</p>

<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse paled at the thought
of such a situation. And his legs shook
beneath him. "Oh! I&mdash;I couldn't do
that!" he stammered. "Can't you think
of some other way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can!" Grandfather replied.
"I'll let him catch me in a hill of corn."</p>

<p>"With corn in your mouth?" Mr. Meadow
Mouse inquired eagerly.</p>

<p>"No!" said Grandfather Mole. "With
<i>you</i> in my mouth!" When he chose,
Grandfather Mole could be very spry.
And as he said those words he made a
quick rush toward Mr. Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>Then there was a great scurrying down
there in the dark.</p>

<h3>MR. CROW'S APOLOGY</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was lucky for Mr. Meadow Mouse that
he had placed a little distance between
himself and Grandfather Mole down in
the gallery under the cornfield. For when
Grandfather Mole rushed at him, Mr.
Meadow Mouse had just enough lead to
escape. He made for the open air as fast
as he could scramble, knowing that Grandfather
Mole could never catch him once he
reached the great out-of-doors.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was only natural that Grandfather
Mole should have been angry with
Mr. Meadow Mouse. Nobody likes to be
accused of thieving&mdash;especially when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_87" id="p_87">p. 87</a></span>
is innocent. And when the real corn
thief (Mr. Meadow Mouse) declined to
take the blame off Grandfather Mole's
shoulders maybe his anger was not altogether
uncalled-for.</p>

<p>After all, Grandfather Mole was glad,
in a way, that Mr. Meadow Mouse had got
away from him. "It proves"&mdash;Grandfather
Mole told himself&mdash;"it proves that
Mr. Meadow Mouse is not only a thief: he's
a coward as well."</p>

<p>At the same time, any one that really
knew old Mr. Crow couldn't have blamed
Mr. Meadow Mouse for not wanting to
follow Grandfather's suggestion. Grandfather
Mole had asked Mr. Meadow Mouse
to allow Mr. Crow to catch him with his
mouth full of corn, so that Mr. Crow might
know that it wasn't Grandfather Mole
that was taking the seed corn, as Mr. Crow
supposed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_88" id="p_88">p. 88</a></span>Mr. Meadow Mouse was too well acquainted
with old Mr. Crow to get himself
into any such fix as that.</p>

<p>When he found himself above ground,
after Grandfather Mole had chased him
out of his galleries, Mr. Meadow Mouse
felt so pleased with himself that he
couldn't help telling his neighbors about
his adventure. He boasted that he had
been eating the seed corn out of the hills.
And he declared that he didn't care if
Mr. Crow heard of it himself.</p>

<p>"It's no more his corn than mine," Mr.
Meadow Mouse said. "It belongs to
Farmer Green. And since he has never
spoken to me about missing any, I don't
believe he cares. Besides, I've often noticed
that he drops more kernels in a hill
than he expects will grow. And really
I've been saving him the trouble of pulling
up a good many young stalks."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_89" id="p_89">p. 89</a></span>All this Mr. Meadow Mouse spread far
and wide. And soon it reached the ears
of old Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>"Ha!" Mr. Crow exclaimed. "So he's
the thief! I'll have to teach him a lesson."</p>

<p>It was Jasper Jay that had related the
news to his cousin, old Mr. Crow. And
now he asked, "What about Grandfather
Mole? Don't you think you ought to
apologize to him?"</p>

<p>That was a strange thing for Jasper Jay
to ask. He was the greatest rowdy in the
woods, with shocking manners.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow gave Jasper a sidewise
glance.</p>

<p>"Will you apologize for me?" he inquired.
"I'm too busy to do it myself."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will!" Jasper Jay cried.
"Leave that to me!" And he hurried off
at once to find Grandfather Mole.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_90" id="p_90">p. 90</a></span>Jasper was lucky enough to see Grandfather
Mole's head sticking out of the
ground, when he reached the garden.</p>

<p>"I have a message for you!" Jasper told
him. "My cousin Mr. Crow&mdash;the old
black rascal!&mdash;was going to punish you
for stealing corn. But he has made other
arrangements."</p>

<p>"Mr. Crow"&mdash;Grandfather Mole spluttered&mdash;"Mr.
Crow owes me an apology."</p>

<p>"Not now, he doesn't!" Jasper disputed.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Grandfather Mole cried.</p>

<p>"Because I've just brought his apology
and given it to you," Jasper Jay replied.</p>

<p>But Grandfather Mole told him to be
gone, and to take the apology away with
him.</p>

<p>"It's nothing but an insult!" Grandfather
Mole declared.</p>

<h3>A SIGN OF RAIN</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Over</span> near the garden fence lay an old
hollow log. Grandfather Mole discovered
it one day; and thinking that it would be
a fine place to look for grubs and other
good things, he crept into one end of it.</p>

<p>If he had been able to see, near the
other end of the log, a pair of bright eyes
that peered at him out of the darkness
perhaps he would have backed out in a
hurry. But it was all right. The owner
of the two eyes was only Sandy Chipmunk.
And he spoke pleasantly to Grandfather
Mole, in a soft sort of chatter, because he
didn't want to alarm him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_92" id="p_92">p. 92</a></span>"Good afternoon!" said Grandfather
Mole. At Sandy's first word he had
jumped. But as soon as he knew who was
in the log with him he felt safe enough.
"What are you doing here, young man?"
Grandfather inquired.</p>

<p>"I came in to get out of the rain,"
Sandy told him.</p>

<p>"Rain!" Grandfather Mole exclaimed.
"It's not raining!"</p>

<p>"I know that. But it's going to," Sandy
Chipmunk replied.</p>

<p>"There's not the least sign of rain,"
Grandfather Mole declared. Being older
than Sandy, he didn't hesitate to dispute
what Sandy said. And he never troubled
himself to apologize, either. Sandy Chipmunk
noticed that, for he had been carefully
reared by his mother. But he knew
that Grandfather Mole was considered an
odd old gentleman. And besides, what<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_93" id="p_93">p. 93</a></span>
could Sandy have said that wouldn't have
sounded rude?</p>

<p>"There's not a sign of rain," Grandfather
Mole repeated, "so far as I can
see."</p>

<p>"How far can you see?" Sandy inquired
politely.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said Grandfather Mole.
"What I mean is that I haven't <i>noticed</i>
anything that foretells rain. For instance,
I haven't had a twinge of rheumatism
since I don't know when."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad of that, anyhow,"
Sandy assured him. "But I saw a sign of
rain to-day that perhaps you never noticed."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"Farmer Green's cat was washing her
face on the doorsteps," Sandy explained
triumphantly. "It's a sure sign of rain.
My mother has never known it to fail."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_94" id="p_94">p. 94</a></span>"Farmer Green's cat!" Grandfather
Mole repeated after him. And he shuddered
as he spoke. "Don't you know that
she's not a trustworthy person? You
surely don't depend on her, I hope! She's
not dependable."</p>

<p>"Well, you can always depend on her
to jump at you," Sandy observed.</p>

<p>"She's a coward&mdash;that's what she is,"
Grandfather Mole scolded. "You never
heard of her chasing anybody that was
bigger than herself, did you? You never
heard of her attacking Fatty Coon!"</p>

<p>Sandy Chipmunk said that if the cat
hunted coons, she kept it to herself.</p>

<p>"She's too wise to run any risk," said
Grandfather Mole. "But if she's washing
her face just because she expects rain,
then she's stupid.</p>

<p>"If the cat wants to wash her face, why
doesn't she stick her head out in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_95" id="p_95">p. 95</a></span>
rain?" Grandfather Mole demanded.
And without waiting for his young companion
to answer, he went on to say that
in his opinion anybody that washed his
face in anything but dirt was stupid beyond
all hope. "I claim," said Grandfather
Mole, "that there's nothing quite
like a dirt bath."</p>

<p>"There aren't many that would agree
with you," Sandy Chipmunk told him.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of stupid people in this
valley," Grandfather Mole retorted.</p>

<p>Sandy Chipmunk thought deeply for a
few moments.</p>

<p>"I know of one person who would say
you were right," he remarked at last.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" Grandfather asked him.</p>

<p>"The boy, Johnnie Green!" Sandy
Chipmunk replied. "If you could <i>see</i> his
face you'd know that he takes a dirt bath
every day!"</p>

<h3>MRS. WREN TRIES TO HELP</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">"Have</span> you found him yet?" Mrs. Rusty
Wren asked Grandfather Mole one day
when the old gentleman had left his dark
underground home to brave the dangers
of the garden.</p>

<p>"Found whom?" Grandfather Mole inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, your grandson! I saw him wandering
about the garden a little while ago.
And I supposed of course that you had
come up to find him."</p>

<p>"Now, that's strange!" Grandfather
Mole exclaimed. "I wasn't aware one of
them had strayed away from the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_97" id="p_97">p. 97</a></span>...
Which of my grandchildren was it
that you saw!"</p>

<p>"I don't know them by name," Mrs.
Wren replied. "But this was just a tiny
chap."</p>

<p>"Then it must be my little grandson
Moses!" Grandfather Mole cried. "He's
the smallest of the lot.... I must find
him at once, before the cat catches him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren saw that Grandfather Mole
was greatly disturbed. And though she
had enough to do&mdash;goodness knows!&mdash;to
look after her own family, she told Grandfather
Mole that she would help him find
his grandchild.</p>

<p>"That's kind of you, I'm sure," Grandfather
Mole remarked. "If I had your
bright eyes I wouldn't need anybody's
help."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're welcome!" Mrs. Wren assured
him. "I shouldn't want a young<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_98" id="p_98">p. 98</a></span>ster
of mine walking about the garden
alone. I'm glad to do what I can. And
meanwhile you had better stay close to
that hole, for there's no need of your running
any risks. If I can't find young
Moses Mole, then nobody can."</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole said she was very
kind and that he would take her advice.
So he stationed himself beside the hole
through which he had lately appeared and
waited there while Rusty Wren's wife
looked for his grandson.</p>

<p>She was a quick, spry little body&mdash;was
Mrs. Wren. It wasn't long before she surprised
the object of her search in the act
of eating a fat grub beside a pumpkin.</p>

<p>"Here he is!" Mrs. Wren called to
Grandfather Mole. "I've found him. Do
you want to come and get him, or shall I
bring him to you?"</p>

</div>


<p>"You'd better bring him," Grandfather<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_99" id="p_99">p. 99</a></span>
Mole answered. And anybody could see
that he was vastly relieved.</p>

<p>A little later Mrs. Wren called to him
again.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" she asked. "He
won't mind me. And he's too heavy for
me to carry."</p>

<p>"That's Moses, without a doubt!"
Grandfather Mole declared. "Yes! If
he won't mind, it's certainly my grandson
Moses. He's the littlest of the family;
and his mother has always spoiled him....
I suppose"&mdash;Grandfather Mole
added&mdash;"I suppose I'll have to go and get
him."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment!" Mrs. Wren suddenly
sang out. "There's some mistake. This
little fellow says his name isn't Moses!"</p>

<p>Well, Grandfather Mole's mouth fell
open, he was so surprised. "Then what's
his name?" he demanded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_100" id="p_100">p. 100</a></span></p>

<p>"He says it's Mr. Shrew. And he
seems very angry over something or
other," Mrs. Wren explained.</p>

<p>"Tell me"&mdash;Grandfather Mole besought
her&mdash;"has he a neck?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren glanced at the small person
whose breakfast she had interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has one," she reported.</p>

<p>"Then he's no relation of mine,"
Grandfather Mole said. "Or at least, he's
no more than a distant cousin. And I
don't even know him." He was relieved
to learn that his grandson Moses Mole was
not wandering about the garden, after all.
"Maybe you never stopped to think that
none of our family have necks&mdash;so far as
you can notice."</p>

<p>And now Mrs. Wren looked at Grandfather
Mole. And she saw that his head
was set right on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I was mistaken," she faltered. "I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_101" id="p_101">p. 101</a></span>
sorry if I upset you about your grandson."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter now," Grandfather
Mole assured her. "To be sure, I was
alarmed. And when you said he wouldn't
mind I was sure it was Moses.</p>

<p>"Children," said Grandfather Mole,
"are not brought up as strictly as they
were when I was young."</p>

<h3>TWO FAMOUS DIGGERS</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Billy Woodchuck</span> had decided to move
into new quarters before cold weather set
in. Old dog Spot had learned where he
lived; and to Billy's dismay Spot was
spending altogether too much of his time
watching Billy's front door.</p>

<p>There was only one reason why Billy
Woodchuck didn't exactly care to dig a
new home for himself in the pasture just
then. The fall crop of clover was about
to head out. And being very fond of
clover blossoms, Billy hated to spend his
time digging.</p>

<p>He was telling his troubles one day to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_103" id="p_103">p. 103</a></span>
old Mr. Crow. And as usual, Mr. Crow
had an idea.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get somebody to help
you?" he asked.</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck looked a bit doubtful.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" he inquired. "Nobody
would be willing to dig for me unless
I paid him."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if I were you I'd offer a modest
wage," Mr. Crow suggested.</p>

<p>But Billy Woodchuck shook his head.</p>

<p>"I couldn't pay anybody anything&mdash;unless
it was clover-tops," he explained.
"And why should any one dig for them
when there are thousands to be had for
the taking?"</p>

<p>Mr. Crow agreed that Billy Woodchuck
knew what he was talking about.</p>

<p>"But," said Mr. Crow, "I've usually
found that there's a way out of every difficulty.
What you must do is to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_104" id="p_104">p. 104</a></span>
somebody that <i>likes</i> to dig&mdash;somebody that
is so crazy to dig that he'd help you just
for the fun of the thing."</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck looked still more
doubtful.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" he asked once more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Crow had been thinking
rapidly&mdash;for he was a quick-witted old
scamp.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you!" he cried. "There's
Grandfather Mole!"</p>

<p>Although Billy Woodchuck brightened
considerably&mdash;for Mr. Crow's ideas made
him more hopeful&mdash;he observed that he
didn't know Grandfather Mole. "I've
heard of him, however," Billy told Mr.
Crow. "He lives in Farmer Green's garden.
But you know I never go there. I
stick to the fields. I don't like to get too
far from home."</p>

<p>"For once, then," said old Mr. Crow, "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_105" id="p_105">p. 105</a></span>
should break my rule&mdash;if I were you&mdash;and
visit the garden. Find Grandfather Mole
and have a talk with him!"</p>

<p>So Billy Woodchuck decided that he
would take Mr. Crow's advice. And
though he hated to leave the clover-patch
he set out that very afternoon to find
Grandfather Mole and ask him if he
wouldn't like to help dig a winter home in
the pasture. But before starting on his
journey Billy Woodchuck waited until
Mr. Crow came back and told him that
Grandfather Mole had just appeared
above ground.</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck hurried off across the
pasture as fast as he could scamper. And
in a short time he reached Farmer
Green's garden. He was somewhat out
of breath, because there had been plenty
of good things to eat all summer long and
he was round as a ball of butter.</p>

<p><a name="i-004" id="i-004"></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_106" id="p_106">p. 106</a></span>Luckily he arrived just in time. Grandfather
Mole had been on the point of
creeping down into one of his many
underground halls when he heard a
strange voice say, "Stop a moment,
please! I've something important to say
to you."</p>

<p>It was a pleasant voice. If it hadn't
been, Grandfather Mole wouldn't have
waited an instant. He turned his head
toward the place where the voice came
from and said, "What is it, stranger?
And talk fast, because I'm busy. I have
some digging to do down below."</p>

<h3>SEEING A SAMPLE</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Grandfather Mole's</span> remark made Billy
Woodchuck smile.</p>

<p>"I'm a very busy person. I've some
digging to do down below," Grandfather
had said.</p>

<p>"You're just the one I need to help
me!" Billy Woodchuck exclaimed, for he
had heard somewhere that if you want a
thing done, you should get a busy person
to do it.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't want me to catch
angleworms for you," Grandfather Mole
told him. "The neighbors are always asking
me to do that. And I've decided that<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_108" id="p_108">p. 108</a></span>
I can't do it. Somehow I can't help eating
'em myself."</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck assured him that he
had no use at all for angleworms.</p>

<p>"What I want," he explained, "is a
good digger to help dig a new house for
me."</p>

<p>"Is anybody else going to help too?"
Grandfather Mole inquired carefully.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;only myself!" Billy said.</p>

<p>"Then I'm sorry; but I can't work for
you," Grandfather Mole announced. And
he had already turned away, as if the business
were ended, when Billy Woodchuck
stopped him again.</p>

<p>"Perhaps"&mdash;said Billy&mdash;"perhaps I
can find one or two others besides myself."</p>

<p>"You've missed my point," said Grandfather
Mole. "I don't want anybody else
to help&mdash;not even you! For I won't share
the fun of digging with any one."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_109" id="p_109">p. 109</a></span>Well, Billy Woodchuck could hardly
believe his own ears.</p>

<p>"You shall have things all your own
way!" he cried. "I won't scratch a speck
of dirt, I promise you!"</p>

<p>"That's different," Grandfather Mole
remarked. "That's more like it. And if
you're a person that keeps his promises
we shall not have a bit of trouble."</p>

<p>"You can depend on me," Billy Woodchuck
told Grandfather Mole. "While
you're working for me I'll spend all my
time in the clover-patch.... And now,"
he added, "I'd like to see a sample of your
digging."</p>

<p>"Come right this way!" Grandfather
Mole directed. And Billy Woodchuck
followed, and looked carefully at the small
hole that Grandfather Mole pointed to
with an air of pride. "Here's one of my
doorways," he announced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_110" id="p_110">p. 110</a></span>With his head on one side, Billy Woodchuck
inspected it.</p>

<p>"It's well made," he said, "but of
course it's entirely too small for my house.
If you work for me you'll have to dig bigger
than that."</p>

<p>That speech did not please Grandfather
Mole. "Small doorways are the only kind
to have," he declared. "I wouldn't make
a bigger one for anybody&mdash;not even for
Farmer Green himself."</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck soon saw that Grandfather
Mole was a stubborn old fellow. No
matter what he said, he couldn't get
Grandfather Mole to change his opinion.
And at last Billy Woodchuck gave up all
hope of having Grandfather Mole dig for
him.</p>

<p>"A door like yours would be of no use
to me," he said dolefully. "I never could
squeeze through it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_111" id="p_111">p. 111</a></span>"My goodness!" Grandfather Mole
cried. "How big are you, anyhow?" It
must be remembered that he couldn't see
his caller.</p>

<p>"I'm big enough," said Billy Woodchuck,
"to put you in my pocket, almost."</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole turned pale at the
mere thought of such a thing.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'd no idea I was talking to a monster,"
he stammered. "I don't believe I
want to dig for you, after all." And saying
a hasty good afternoon, he popped
through his doorway and vanished at Billy
Woodchuck's feet.</p>

<p>Greatly disappointed, Billy Woodchuck
turned homewards. "I'd have been in a
pretty fix if he had finished my house, and
I had tried to move my furniture into it,"
he muttered. "It's lucky I asked to see a
sample of Grandfather Mole's work," said
Billy Woodchuck.</p>

<h3>FOLLOWING THE PLOUGH</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A good</span> many of Grandfather Mole's
neighbors sneered at him, and said he was
queer. Mr. Blackbird was one of these
scoffers. Though he was a lazy scamp,
he always managed to look sleek and well
fed. And he liked the same fare that
Grandfather Mole did.</p>

<p>"You're a goose to work so hard for
your food," Mr. Blackbird jeered one fine
spring day as he sat on the garden fence
and looked down at Grandfather Mole.
"You ought to change your habits. Just
look at me! I get plenty to eat. And I
do precious little digging for it, believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_113" id="p_113">p. 113</a></span>
me! I tell you, there's a better way than
yours!"</p>

<p>Naturally, Grandfather Mole couldn't
look at Mr. Blackbird. But he raised his
head in his odd fashion.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he inquired. "What's
a better way than mine?"</p>

<p>But Mr. Blackbird was in no hurry to
tell all he knew.</p>

<p>"Suppose," he said, "I should explain
my method to you. You could follow it
for some weeks and live well without much
trouble. And then&mdash;when the spring
ploughing is finished&mdash;I should want you
to supply me with angleworms for the
same length of time. You know, you can't
expect me to give away my secret for nothing."</p>

<p>"But I <i>like</i> to dig," Grandfather Mole
replied. "You may have noticed that I
am built for that sort of work."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_114" id="p_114">p. 114</a></span>What Grandfather Mole said was true.
His drill-like nose, his powerful fore-legs
and big, strong feet all served to make him
the fastest digger in Pleasant Valley.</p>

<p>Mr. Blackbird regarded him with a sly
smile. "You seem to be built for <i>eating</i>,
too," he observed.</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole soon confessed that
Mr. Blackbird's mention of angleworms
had made him so hungry that he was
ready to promise to do as Mr. Blackbird
had proposed.</p>

<p>So Mr. Blackbird cried that it was a
bargain.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "listen carefully
while I whisper the secret, for I don't
want everybody to hear it.... I follow
the plough," he explained. "It turns up
a great quantity of angleworms. The only
work I have to do is to pick 'em up with
my bill."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_115" id="p_115">p. 115</a></span>Somehow Grandfather Mole did not appear
as delighted as Mr. Blackbird had
expected.</p>

<p>"How can I follow the plough when I
can't see where it's going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Silly!" Mr. Blackbird jeered. "You
can find your way along a furrow, can't
you?"</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole thought he could do
that. "But you're forgetting Henry
Hawk!" he reminded Mr. Blackbird.
"Farmer Green ploughs in the daytime.
And Henry Hawk might see me."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't be likely to notice you if
you crept along the bottom of a furrow,"
Mr. Blackbird assured Grandfather Mole.
"Anyhow, I'll be there. And I'll warn
you if Henry Hawk appears in the sky."</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole was relieved. And
Mr. Blackbird told him to be ready the
next morning.</p>



<hr class="chapter" /><p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_116" id="p_116">p. 116</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XXV" id="XXV"></a>XXV</h2>

<h3>STUBBORN AS EVER</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Farmer Green</span> hadn't finished ploughing
his first furrow before Mr. Blackbird and
Grandfather Mole began breakfasting on
the angleworms that the plough turned
up.</p>

<p>Very soon Mr. Blackbird began to regret
his bargain with Grandfather Mole,
for Grandfather was even a greater eater
than Mr. Blackbird had supposed. Mr.
Blackbird began to be afraid that there
wouldn't be worms enough left for himself.</p>

<p>"This is a fine place to dig," he remarked
to Grandfather Mole in what<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_117" id="p_117">p. 117</a></span>
seemed a careless way. But he watched
Grandfather Mole narrowly, with a grin
on his face, to see what the old chap would
do.</p>

<p>And after that Grandfather Mole
couldn't resist burrowing in the loose
earth now and then. It pleased Mr.
Blackbird to see him amuse himself in
that fashion, because while he was digging
Grandfather Mole lost his chance at
a good many angleworms. They found
their way quickly down Mr. Blackbird's
throat. And it was not long before he was
in the best of spirits.</p>

<p>Day after day while the spring ploughing
went on, the strange pair followed the
plough together. And since Grandfather
Mole spent more than half the time in digging,
Mr. Blackbird felt that on the whole
their bargain had proved a good one.</p>

<p>When Farmer Green had finished the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_118" id="p_118">p. 118</a></span>
last furrow in the field Mr. Blackbird told
Grandfather Mole that the ploughing had
come to an end.</p>

<p>"And now"&mdash;he said&mdash;"now it's your
turn to carry out your part of the bargain.
I showed you where the food was plentiful;
and it's time for you to begin furnishing
me twenty fat angleworms a day."</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole was amazed. There
hadn't been a word said about the <i>number</i>
of angleworms he was to supply Mr.
Blackbird.</p>

<p>"Twenty!" he exclaimed. "Nobody
said 'twenty!'"</p>

<p>"That's so," said Mr. Blackbird. "It
was forty."</p>

<p>Grandfather Mole was staggered. But
he didn't dare object again, for fear Mr.
Blackbird would double the number once
more and make it eighty.</p>

<p>"Agreed!" he cried. "And I'll have<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_119" id="p_119">p. 119</a></span>
them ready for you at midnight regularly."</p>

<p>"Midnight!" Mr. Blackbird repeated
after him, in great surprise. "Nothing
was said about 'midnight!'"</p>

<p>"That's so!" Grandfather Mole admitted.
"It was one o'clock in the morning."
And in spite of everything Mr.
Blackbird said, Grandfather Mole
wouldn't change the time. Everybody
knew that he was very stubborn.</p>

<p>"A hundred angleworms in the middle
of the night wouldn't do me any good,"
Mr. Blackbird complained. "I'm always
asleep at that time."</p>

<p>"You'd better change your habits,"
Grandfather Mole replied. "You ought
to be glad to change your hours for sleep,
if it would make things easier for you."</p>

<p>Now that was very like the sort of remark
that Mr. Blackbird himself had<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_120" id="p_120">p. 120</a></span>
once made to Grandfather Mole. But
coming from Grandfather Mole the suggestion
did not please him. He even lost
his temper. And he told Grandfather
Mole that he was the queerest person in all
Pleasant Valley.</p>

<p>But that speech did not trouble Grandfather
Mole.</p>

<p>"It's everybody else that's queer&mdash;and
not I!" he declared.</p>

<hr class="wide" />
<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: 0em;">These little books for
little people tell of the adventures
of the four-footed creatures of our American woods
and fields in an amusing way which delights small two-footed
human beings; and at the same time, in the shortcomings of
Cuffy Bear and his neighbors, children are quick to recognize
their own faults and to take home the obvious lessons.</p>

<hr class="wide" />
<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: 0em;">The stories of Jolly
Robin, Old Mr. Crow and the other
birds are as unusual as they are delightful, since this is
almost the first time these feathered friends of the kiddies
have appeared in print. These bird stories, like the Sleepy-Time
animal stories, are based upon actual natural history
facts, but while the youngster eagerly listens to them, a moral
foundation, of deeper importance than that in natural history,
is being laid.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: 0em;">The kiddies will love
these fascinating stories of Farmyard
Folk, which tell of the daily doings of Muley Cow,
Old Dog Spot, and their companions. These tales will show
them that they have much in common with Henrietta Hen
and the others, and will develop in them a wholesome respect
for those good friends.</p>
